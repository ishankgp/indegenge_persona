    Generate a response in a pure JSON format. Do not include any text, code block markers, or explanations before or after the JSON object. The JSON object must have the following keys:
    - "name": A realistic first and last name.
    - "demographics": An object with "age", "gender", "location", and "occupation".
    - "medical_background": A brief, narrative summary of their diagnosis and treatment history for the specified condition.
