Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) Patient Journey: Understanding the Emotional and Clinical Landscape

Epidemiology: Over 37 million Americans live with diabetes, with 90-95% having Type 2 Diabetes. The diagnosis often comes after years of prediabetes, creating a sense of regret and missed opportunities for earlier intervention.

Patient Emotional Burden: Newly diagnosed patients experience significant emotional distress. They worry about complications—vision loss, kidney disease, amputation—that they've heard about from family members. There's a fear of dependence on medications and the stigma of "failing" at managing their health through diet alone.

Treatment Progression Reality: Most patients start with metformin, but 50% require additional therapy within 3 years due to progressive beta-cell decline. This progression feels like personal failure, when it's actually the natural course of the disease. Patients desire treatments that halt this decline and restore their sense of control.

Barriers to Optimal Care: Cost concerns are paramount—67% of patients report worrying about medication affordability. Complexity of regimens creates fatigue; patients juggle multiple pills, different timing requirements, and fear of hypoglycemia. They seek simplicity and convenience without compromising efficacy.

Quality of Life Impact: Beyond glucose numbers, patients care deeply about energy levels, ability to participate in family activities, and maintaining independence. Weight gain from some diabetes medications adds to their frustration, particularly when obesity contributed to their diagnosis.

What Patients Want: Our research shows patients prioritize three things: 1) Proven results in preventing complications, 2) Minimal disruption to daily life, 3) Support in achieving weight goals alongside diabetes management. They want to feel empowered, not overwhelmed.
