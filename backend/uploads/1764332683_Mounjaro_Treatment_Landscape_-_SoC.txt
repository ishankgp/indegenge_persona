Current Standard of Care and Competitive Analysis for Type 2 Diabetes

First-Line Therapy: Metformin remains the standard initial therapy per ADA guidelines, with 78% of newly diagnosed patients starting here. However, metformin alone rarely maintains glycemic control long-term, with most patients requiring intensification.

GLP-1 Receptor Agonist Class: The landscape has shifted dramatically toward GLP-1 RAs due to CV and renal benefits. Key competitors include:
- Ozempic (semaglutide): Once-weekly, 1.5% A1C reduction, strong weight loss (12-15 lbs average)
- Trulicity (dulaglutide): Once-weekly, 1.3% A1C reduction, moderate weight loss
- Victoza (liraglutide): Daily injection, proven CV benefit, 1.2% A1C reduction

SGLT2 Inhibitors: Jardiance and Farxiga offer CV and renal protection with modest A1C reduction (0.7-0.8%), popular among cardiologists and nephrologists.

Treatment Selection Drivers: Physicians consider A1C gap to goal, CV/renal risk profile, weight status, injection acceptance, and cost/coverage. HCPs express frustration with prior authorization delays and coverage denials that prevent optimal therapy.

Unmet Needs in Current Landscape:
- Greater A1C reduction without increasing hypoglycemia risk
- Superior weight loss to address obesity epidemic
- Simplified once-weekly dosing with easy titration
- Reduced GI side effects that cause discontinuation
- Cost-effective options given insurance barriers

Physician Perspectives: Endocrinologists seek "best-in-class" efficacy for complex patients. PCPs value safety, simplicity, and tolerability for their busy practices. Both desire treatments that improve adherence through convenient dosing and meaningful patient-reported benefits.

Market Opportunity: With only 35% of T2D patients at goal A1C <7%, there's significant room for more effective therapies that patients will actually take consistently.
