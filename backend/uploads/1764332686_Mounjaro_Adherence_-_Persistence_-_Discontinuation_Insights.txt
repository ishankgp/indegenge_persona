Mounjaro Adherence and Persistence: Real-World Evidence and Insights

Discontinuation Rates in Clinical Trials:
- Overall discontinuation: 6.2% due to adverse events through 2 years
- Primarily GI-related in first 12 weeks (4.8%)
- Efficacy-related discontinuation: <1% (very rare)
- Late discontinuation (>6 months): 1.4% (mostly non-AE reasons)

Persistence Comparison: Early real-world data suggests Mounjaro 12-month persistence rate of 78%, comparing favorably to historical GLP-1 RA persistence (65-72%). Superior efficacy and weight loss likely drive improved adherence.

GI Tolerability and Adherence: Analysis shows patients who experience mild-moderate nausea in first month have similar 12-month adherence (74%) as those without nausea (79%), suggesting good overall tolerance when expectations are set appropriately.

Factors Associated with Better Persistence:
- Prior GLP-1 RA experience (82% vs 76% naive patients)
- Strong weight loss results in first 3 months (86% persistence)
- Low out-of-pocket costs <$50/month (91% vs 62% >$50)
- Enrollment in patient support program (84% vs 71%)
- Specialist vs PCP prescriber (83% vs 74%)

Reasons for Discontinuation (Beyond AE):
- Cost/insurance loss (32% of discontinuations)
- Reached glycemic goal and wanted to simplify (18%)
- Physician-initiated switch or add-on (15%)
- Patient discretion/unknown (35%)

Device and Administration Factors: Single-dose pen design with hidden needle contributes to high injection acceptance. Injection confidence scores improve from 6.2/10 at baseline to 8.7/10 at 12 weeks.

Interventions That Improve Persistence:
- Proactive outreach at week 2-4 to address GI side effects
- Early weight loss counseling to set expectations
- Copay assistance enrollment and monitoring
- Provider education on titration strategies
- Patient success stories and peer support

Long-term Adherence Insights: Patients who persist beyond 6 months show excellent long-term adherence (>85% at 2 years), suggesting early period is critical window for support and intervention.

Clinical Implications: Maximizing adherence requires:
1. Pre-treatment counseling on expected GI effects and management
2. Aggressive copay assistance and insurance navigation support
3. Close follow-up in first 3 months with encouragement
4. Celebrating weight loss wins to maintain motivation
5. Simplifying concomitant medication regimen where possible
