Mounjaro Market Research: HCP and Patient Insights

HCP Qualitative Research Findings (N=120 physicians across specialties):

Switching Dynamics: 45% of physicians report willingness to switch patients from current GLP-1 to Mounjaro based on superior efficacy data. However, 60% prefer trial in GLP-1-naive patients first due to insurance step-therapy requirements.

Key Barriers Identified:
- Prior authorization hassles (cited by 82% as primary barrier)
- Uncertainty about patient coverage/copay (78%)
- Concern about GI tolerability in practice vs trials (55%)
- Lack of long-term CV outcome data (40%)

Physician Enthusiasm: Despite barriers, 88% agree Mounjaro represents "meaningful advancement" over existing GLP-1 RAs. Endocrinologists show highest enthusiasm (Net Promoter Score: +67), PCPs more cautious (+42).

Ideal Patient Profile (HCP Perspective): Patients with A1C >8% despite metformin +/- other oral agents, BMI >30, good injection acceptance, commercial insurance or Medicare Part D with strong coverage.

Patient-Reported Insights (N=500 T2D patients):

Treatment Goal Priorities:
1. Avoiding complications (ranked #1 by 68%)
2. A1C control without hypoglycemia (61%)
3. Weight loss (54%)
4. Convenient dosing (48%)
5. Medication cost (43%)

Injection Acceptance: 72% willing to consider weekly injection if it meant better results than daily pills. Fear of injections significantly lower than 10 years ago due to GLP-1 class familiarity.

Weight Loss as Motivator: 83% of patients with BMI >30 state weight loss is "extremely" or "very" important consideration in diabetes treatment choice. This represents significant motivational leverage for Mounjaro.

Cost Sensitivity: 67% would not start therapy if monthly cost exceeded $75. Copay assistance program awareness and enrollment is critical for uptake.

Information Sources Patients Trust:
1. Physician recommendation (87%)
2. Pharmacy counseling (52%)
3. Patient support programs (41%)
4. Online reviews from other patients (38%)

Critical Success Factors: Research indicates success requires:
- Clear HCP education on appropriate patient selection
- Proactive management of PA/coverage issues
- GI side effect management tools and patient prep
- Robust copay assistance and patient support program
- Patient testimonials showcasing real-world results
