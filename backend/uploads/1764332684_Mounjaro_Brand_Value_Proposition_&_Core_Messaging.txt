Mounjaro (tirzepatide): Redefining Diabetes Control

Unique Mechanism: Mounjaro is the first and only GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist, combining dual incretin action for superior glycemic control and weight reduction. This dual mechanism addresses both insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction.

Efficacy Leadership: SURPASS clinical trial program demonstrated:
- Up to 2.6% A1C reduction (vs 1.9% for semaglutide 1mg)
- 84% of patients reached A1C <7% (vs 67% comparator)
- Average weight loss of 15-25 lbs (dose-dependent)
- Sustained efficacy through 2+ years

Core Message: "Mounjaro delivers what matters most—powerful A1C reduction and significant weight loss in one once-weekly injection."

Patient Benefits:
- Confidence in reaching glycemic goals with superior efficacy
- Meaningful weight loss that improves overall health and self-esteem
- Convenient once-weekly dosing fits seamlessly into life
- Reduced worry about diabetes progression and complications

HCP Value Proposition:
- Most effective option for patients needing intensive glucose control
- Addresses both hyperglycemia and obesity in one agent
- Simple, predictable titration schedule
- Differentiated mechanism provides alternative for GLP-1 non-responders

Competitive Differentiation:
- Superior A1C reduction vs all GLP-1 RAs
- Greater weight loss than any other diabetes medication
- Novel dual incretin mechanism
- Proven non-inferiority for CV safety

Brand Personality: Empowering, innovative, results-driven. Mounjaro represents hope for patients tired of incremental improvements—it's a breakthrough that delivers transformational results.
