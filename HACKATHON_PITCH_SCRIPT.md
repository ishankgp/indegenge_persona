# Pharma Persona Simulator - Hackathon Pitch Script
## 2-Minute Presentation

---

### **INTRODUCTION & PROBLEM STATEMENT (30 seconds)**
"Hi everyone, I'm presenting **Pharma Persona Simulator** - an AI tool that helps pharmaceutical companies test their messaging before launch.

The problem: Companies spend millions on campaigns without knowing if patients will respond. Traditional market research is slow and expensive.

We built a simulation platform that creates patient personas and predicts their responses across multiple metrics."

### **FUTURE POTENTIAL (20 seconds)**
"Looking ahead, we're working on multimodal input capabilities - analyzing audio recordings, video content, and patient testimonials to generate more sophisticated persona responses.

The tool could serve both external pharmaceutical companies and internal Indegene teams for optimizing patient engagement strategies, clinical trial design, and education programs."
