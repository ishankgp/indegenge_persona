# Pharma Persona Simulator - Hackathon Pitch Script
## 2-Minute Presentation

---

### **INTRODUCTION & PROBLEM STATEMENT (30 seconds)**
"Hi everyone, I am Ishan representing Team Fintuners. We have built a persona simulator.

Pharmaceutical companies face a critical challenge: they spend millions on campaigns that fail because they don't understand patient behavior. Traditional market research is slow and expensive.

 We've developed an AI-powered simulation platform that generates realistic patient personas and predicts their responses to pharmaceutical messaging. It provides insights across key metrics like purchase intent, brand trust, and message clarity, significantly reducing market research costs."

### **BENEFITS OF LLM-GENERATED PERSONAS (15 seconds)**
"Our platform leverages large language models to generate highly realistic and diverse patient personas. These personas are crafted using vast datasets, allowing them to reflect real-world patient behaviors and preferences accurately. This approach not only enhances the precision of our simulations but also provides a scalable solution to test various scenarios, ensuring that marketing strategies are both effective and empathetic."

### **DEMO TRANSITION (10 seconds)**
"Now, let's see our platform in action.  While we'll demonstrate with a few personas, our platform is designed to scale to hundreds or even thousands for a truly comprehensive view."

### **DEMO (Analytics Dashboard)**
"Let's take a look at the analytics dashboard where we have analyzed the responses of 4 personas to a stimulus text. The analysis was completed on 29/08/2025 at 23:32:26. The stimulus text was: 'From managing blood sugar to easing joint pain, preventing migraine attacks, or breathing easier with lung careâ€”modern therapies let you stay active, share meals with friends, and live life without constant setbacks.'

The key metrics we analyzed include Purchase Intent, Sentiment, Brand Trust, and Message Clarity. Here are the average scores:
- Purchase Intent: 5.5 (Scale of 1-10)
- Sentiment: 0.30 (Scale of -1 to 1)
- Brand Trust: 6.0 (Scale of 1-10)
- Message Clarity: 7.5 (Scale of 1-10)

Key insights from the cohort analysis include:
1. Moderate purchase intent - message has potential but may need refinement.
2. Neutral sentiment - message is well-received but may need emotional enhancement.
3. Safety and side effects are primary concerns - consider addressing these more prominently.
4. Effectiveness concerns detected - consider providing more efficacy data or testimonials.

Now, let's dive into the individual persona responses to see how each persona reacted to the message."

### **FUTURE POTENTIAL (20 seconds)**
"Beyond this current version, we're developing multimodal capabilities - you'll be able to upload audio, video, and patient testimonials for even more sophisticated analysis. We're particularly excited about integrating real-time feedback loops. This tool could serve both external pharmaceutical companies and internal Indegene teams, helping optimize patient engagement across the entire healthcare ecosystem."

---

### **CLOSING (10 seconds)**
"Thank you for your attention. And with this tool, our goal isn't to replace human studies but to enhance them. We aim to refine the material before it reaches human trials, ensuring that the studies are more efficient and the messaging is precise"
