## Abstract

**Background:** Obesity is a chronic disease that results in substantial global morbidity and mortality. The efficacy and safety of tirzepatide, a novel glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, in people with obesity are not known.

**Methods:** In this phase 3 double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, we assigned 2539 adults with a body-mass index (BMI) of 30 or more, or 27 or more and at least one weight-related complication, excluding diabetes, in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive once-weekly, subcutaneous tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg) or placebo for 72 weeks, including a 20-week dose-escalation period.

**Coprimary end points:** 
- Percentage change in weight from baseline
- Weight reduction of 5% or more

## Key Results

### Baseline Characteristics
- Mean body weight: **104.8 kg**
- Mean BMI: **38.0**
- 94.5% of participants had BMI ≥ 30

### Weight Loss Results at Week 72

| Dose | Mean % Weight Change | 95% CI |
|------|---------------------|--------|
| 5 mg | **-15.0%** | -15.9 to -14.2 |
| 10 mg | **-19.5%** | -20.4 to -18.5 |
| 15 mg | **-20.9%** | -21.8 to -19.9 |
| Placebo | -3.1% | -4.3 to -1.9 |

*P<0.001 for all comparisons with placebo*

### Participants Achieving ≥5% Weight Reduction

| Dose | Percentage (95% CI) |
|------|---------------------|
| 5 mg | 85% (82-89) |
| 10 mg | 89% (86-92) |
| 15 mg | 91% (88-94) |
| Placebo | 35% (30-39) |

### Participants Achieving ≥20% Weight Reduction

| Dose | Percentage (95% CI) |
|------|---------------------|
| 10 mg | 50% (46-54) |
| 15 mg | 57% (53-61) |
| Placebo | 3% (1-5) |

## Safety Profile

**Most common adverse events:** Gastrointestinal (mild to moderate severity, occurring primarily during dose escalation)

**Treatment discontinuation rates:**
- 5 mg: 4.3%
- 10 mg: 7.1%
- 15 mg: 6.2%
- Placebo: 2.6%

## Conclusions

In this 72-week trial in participants with obesity, 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg of tirzepatide once weekly provided substantial and sustained reductions in body weight. Improvements in all prespecified cardiometabolic measures were observed with tirzepatide.
