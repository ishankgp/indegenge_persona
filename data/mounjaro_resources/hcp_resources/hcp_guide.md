## Mechanism of Action

Tirzepatide is a **dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist**:

**GLP-1 (Glucagon-Like Peptide-1) Actions:**
- Stimulates glucose-dependent insulin secretion
- Suppresses glucagon secretion
- Slows gastric emptying
- Reduces appetite and food intake

**GIP (Glucose-Dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide) Actions:**
- Potentiates insulin secretion
- May have direct effects on adipose tissue metabolism
- Contributes to enhanced weight loss vs GLP-1-only agents

**Dual Agonism Advantage:**
The combination of GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonism may lead to greater improvements in glycemic control and weight loss compared to GLP-1 receptor agonists alone.
