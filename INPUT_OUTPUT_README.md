2. Prompt(s) used (with redactions as needed)
3. Inputs provided (summarized)
4. Output examples (snippets or links)
5. Observed challenges (e.g., factual drift, tone, clinical nuance)
6. Mitigations and best practices (prompting patterns, validation steps, compliance checks)

## Notes
- Keep any PHI/PII out of inputs and outputs.
- Cite study sources where applicable in summaries.
- If multiple territories/labels exist, keep separate `sampleX` folders per market.
