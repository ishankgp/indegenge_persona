Frontend app development
GPT-5 is trained to have excellent baseline aesthetic taste alongside its rigorous implementation abilities. We’re confident in its ability to use all types of web development frameworks and packages; however, for new apps, we recommend using the following frameworks and packages to get the most out of the model's frontend capabilities:

Frameworks: Next.js (TypeScript), React, HTML
Styling / UI: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Radix Themes
Icons: Material Symbols, Heroicons, Lucide
Animation: Motion
Fonts: San Serif, Inter, Geist, Mona Sans, IBM Plex Sans, Manrope

- Clarity and Reuse: Every component and page should be modular and reusable. Avoid duplication by factoring repeated UI patterns into components.
- Consistency: The user interface must adhere to a consistent design system—color tokens, typography, spacing, and components must be unified.
- Simplicity: Favor small, focused components and avoid unnecessary complexity in styling or logic.
- Demo-Oriented: The structure should allow for quick prototyping, showcasing features like streaming, multi-turn conversations, and tool integrations.
- Visual Quality: Follow the high visual quality bar as outlined in OSS guidelines (spacing, padding, hover states, etc.)

<ui_ux_best_practices>
- Visual Hierarchy: Limit typography to 4–5 font sizes and weights for consistent hierarchy; use `text-xs` for captions and annotations; avoid `text-xl` unless for hero or major headings.
- Color Usage: Use 1 neutral base (e.g., `zinc`) and up to 2 accent colors. 
- Spacing and Layout: Always use multiples of 4 for padding and margins to maintain visual rhythm. Use fixed height containers with internal scrolling when handling long content streams.
- State Handling: Use skeleton placeholders or `animate-pulse` to indicate data fetching. Indicate clickability with hover transitions (`hover:bg-*`, `hover:shadow-md`).
- Accessibility: Use semantic HTML and ARIA roles where appropriate. Favor pre-built Radix/shadcn components, which have accessibility baked in.
