# PharmaPersonaSim - 1 Minute Demo Script
## Transform Qualitative Personas into Quantitative Insights

### üè• HACKATHON POSITIONING
**The Challenge**: Pharmaceutical companies rely on expensive, time-consuming market research ($2.6B annually, 6-month cycles) that delays critical drug launches and patient access to life-saving treatments.

**Our Innovation**: PharmaPersonaSim is the first AI-powered platform that transforms static patient personas into dynamic, interactive simulations using Large Language Models - delivering pharmaceutical market insights in minutes instead of months.

**Competitive Edge**: Unlike traditional survey tools, we create living, breathing AI personas that can respond to multimedia content, provide emotional context, and scale across entire patient populations instantly.

**Market Impact**: 90% reduction in research time, 70% cost savings, and unlimited scalability for enterprise pharmaceutical clients through Indegene's global network.
