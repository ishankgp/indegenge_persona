1. ESSENTIAL

“Minimalist, rep-only, no time for fluff.”

Identity & Context

Name: Dr. Michael Chen

Age/Gender: 49, Male

Location: Tier-1 city, tertiary hospital

Specialty: Critical Care / Internal Medicine

Practice Setup: High-acuity ICU, heavy caseload, academic plus on-call

System Context: Hospital protocols drive choice; strict formulary

Decision Influencers: Hospital guidelines, senior KOLs, internal P&T committee

MBT

Goals / Motivations

Maintain protocol-aligned, evidence-based care; zero drama with Pharmacy/Administration

Avoid stock-outs / formulary conflicts

Get only clinically relevant, outcome-impacting updates

Minimize cognitive overload in a chaotic environment

Beliefs

“If it’s important, it will be in guidelines or hospital protocols.”

“Reps exist to serve my information need, not shape my philosophy.”

“Digital promos = clutter; vetted PDFs and summaries are enough.”

Tensions & Pain Points

No time: 10–12 hr shifts + calls; ignores non-essential outreach

Distrusts brand bias; wants head-to-head + hard endpoints

Hospital formulary blocks many “interesting” options anyway

Behavior Layer

Adherence to Protocols: Very high; rarely deviates

Channel Use:

Accepts occasional in-person rep if concise & data-first

Ignores bulk email / portals / webinars

Decision Style: Rational, guideline-led, low openness to novelty

Core Insight (Primary Driver)

He wants only what is essential to keep patients safe and compliant with hospital policy, believes credible info should be short, referenced, and protocol-aligned, so he engages only when brands respect his time and context.

Activation Hooks

What to Do:

1-pager clinical updates; formulary-fit flags; ICU-relevant evidence

Rep visits only when there’s real change (guideline update, new RWE, protocol tweak)

Never Do: Long brand stories, “relationship-building” lunches, generic digital spam

CTA: “Here is the 1 change that affects your ICU protocol this month.”

2. TRADITIONALIST

“Rep-first, relationship-driven, pragmatic prescriber.”

Identity & Context

Name: Dr. Anita Rao

Age/Gender: 55, Female

Location: Tier-2 city, high-volume cardiology clinic + nursing home rounds

Specialty: Cardiology

System Context: Mix of private pay & insurance; brand loyal

Decision Influencers: Long-standing rep relationships, peer KOLs, CME events

MBT

Goals / Motivations

Provide reliable, proven therapies with predictable outcomes

Maintain smooth clinic flow; avoid switching chaos

Reward companies that “show up” with support, samples, and CME

Beliefs

“If I know and trust the company & rep, I can trust their brands.”

“New isn’t always better; I wait till I see comfort in the community.”

“Face-to-face is still the best way to understand a product.”

Tensions & Pain Points

Overloaded with patients; limited time to verify every claim

Feels abandoned when brands go fully digital

Regulatory noise makes her fear being misled or audited

Behavior Layer

Adherence: High to her own habits; tough to shift once stable

Channel Use:

Strong preference for rep calls, CMEs, small round tables

Light email use; rarely logs in to portals

Decision Style: Trust & experience-led, conservative adopter

Core Insight

She wants trusted, low-friction, proven solutions, believes relationships + reputation = risk protection, so face-to-face, continuity, and tangible support are the levers to drive prescribing.

Activation Hooks

What to Do: Consistent field presence, localized CME, quick leave-behinds, patient education kits

Never Do: Push her to “self-serve portal” as primary mode

CTA: “Talk to our MSL / join this focused CME to validate what you already use.”

3. SEEKER

“Data-hungry, hybrid, open to being convinced.”

Identity & Context

Name: Dr. Elena Petrova

Age/Gender: 38, Female

Location: Urban academic center

Specialty: Endocrinology

System Context: Mix of clinical + research; involved in trials

Decision Influencers: Peer-reviewed data, guidelines, expert webinars, key congresses

MBT

Goals / Motivations

Stay ahead of the curve; offer latest evidence-based options

Build academic credibility

Personalize therapy (co-morbidities, access, biomarkers)

Beliefs

“If there is robust data + guideline alignment, I’m in.”

“Digital is efficient if curated; I don’t need handholding.”

“Pharma can be a partner if transparent on data & limitations.”

Tensions & Pain Points

Over-supply of mediocre content; under-supply of deep clinical insight

Time fragmented; hates redundant rep calls

Needs fast answers to nuanced questions (subgroups, comorbidities, RWE)

Behavior Layer

Adherence: High to evidence; fast but rational adopter

Channel Use:

Engages with webinars, on-demand content, HCP portals

Selective rep access; prefers MSLs for complex topics

Decision Style: Analytical, self-directed, digitally comfortable

Core Insight

She wants high-quality, on-demand, evidence-dense content, believes good data + autonomy > promotional noise, so brands that enable smart self-service + expert access will win disproportionate share.

Activation Hooks

What to Do:

Tiered resources: RCT decks, RWE tools, subgroup explorers

Smart portal with rapid MSL escalation; congress highlights

Never Do: Surface-level brand fluff

CTA: “Explore outcomes in your patient type in 2 clicks; book a 15-min MSL slot if needed.”

4. CONSTRAINED

“Wants to engage, blocked by system, admin, or context.”

Identity & Context

Name: Dr. Luis Martinez

Age/Gender: 42, Male

Location: Public hospital + satellite clinic, lower-income catchment

Specialty: Oncology

System Context: Formularies, tenders, reimbursement caps, overloaded OPD

Decision Influencers: National guidelines, hospital board, cost-effectiveness, NGOs

MBT

Goals / Motivations

Give patients equitable access to effective therapies

Navigate constraints without feeling complicit in undertreatment

Use tools that simplify prior auths, documentation, and patient support

Beliefs

“Best treatment is useless if my patients can’t access or afford it.”

“Pharma support is acceptable if it’s transparent and patient-centric.”

“I need help operationalizing care, not just hearing about molecules.”

Tensions & Pain Points

Reimbursement restrictions vs clinical ideal

Admin load; drowning in paperwork, prior auth, documentation

Fragmented support programs, each with different processes

Behavior Layer

Adherence: Tries to balance guidelines with affordability

Channel Use:

Responds to very targeted rep/MSL who solve real logistic problems

Uses email/WhatsApp for quick docs, forms, support links

Decision Style: Constrained optimizer; not against innovation, but blocked

Core Insight

He is motivated to do the right thing but structurally blocked, believes access + process support matter as much as efficacy, so solutions that reduce friction (paperwork, affordability, navigation) unlock adoption.

Activation Hooks

What to Do:

Streamlined patient support, templates, prior-auth packs

Co-created case-based content framed for constrained settings

Never Do: Pitch premium brands without an access story

CTA: “Here’s how to get eligible patients on this therapy with minimal extra steps.”

5. ENTHUSIAST

Identity & Context

Name: Dr. Sara Nilsson

Age/Gender: 34, Female

Location: Metro private multi-specialty + telehealth

Specialty: Respiratory / Allergy

System Context: Tech-forward clinic; affluent + digital-first patients

Decision Influencers: Global congresses, preprints, KOLs on X/LinkedIn, own analytics

MBT

Goals / Motivations

Be an early adopter of validated innovations

Build digital presence, thought leadership, and patient trust

Use tools, apps, and data to optimize adherence & experience

Beliefs

“If it’s not digital, it’s behind.”

“Engagement should be two-way, personalized, and continuous.”

Tensions & Pain Points

Fragmented experiences across brand portals & platforms

Content rarely tailored to her advanced knowledge level

Bored by basic rep pitches; wants API > brochure

Behavior Layer

Adherence: Rapid adopter; experiments within evidence and safety

Channel Use:

Heavy on on-demand portals, apps, webinars, podcasts, chat, remote MSL

Social media active; influences peers

Decision Style: Self-directed, data & UX sensitive, networked

Core Insight

She wants to co-create the future of care, believes always-on, personalized, tech-enabled engagement is table stakes, so integrated, API-like, omnichannel support converts her into a vocal advocate.

Activation Hooks

What to Do:

Early access to data, tools, calculators, APIs, patient-facing apps

Invite to advisory boards, beta programs, co-creation sprints

Never Do: Treat her like a mass email recipient or “average GP”

CTA: “Test this new decision-support module with your patients; your feedback shapes v2.”
